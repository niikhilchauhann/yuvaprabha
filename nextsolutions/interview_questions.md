## A. General Questions

1. Stateless Widget: Once created, it cannot change its state or the way it looks and works in the runtime.
   Stateful Widget: Can change its state during the runtime. Shows instant changes.

2. To manage project dependencies. Handling metadata like project name, version code and app's description. Stores location of assets and fonts which are needed in the app.

3. A widget is the basic building block of the Flutter. Everything in Flutter is a widget, whatever we see on the screen is a widget. It may be used to define the UI or the layout of the app.

4. Dart is a lightweight programming language which provides high performance compiled code that can run on different platforms. It has several built in functions making it easy and efficient for development.

5. It pushes the updated code into the runtime of the app so that we can see changes immediately without having to recompile the entire code.

6. The build method is an inbuilt function that is called whenever the widget needs to be updated or when the app's state gets changed.

7. Navigator is a class in flutter that is used to maintain the flow of the app. It is used to move from one page to another and also maintain the stack of pages beneath. It has several inbuilt functions like push, pop, pushAndPopUntil etc.

Routes are the various screens of the app that we can navigate through. Routes can be named or can be called upon directly as widgets.
